# Post place-based solutions

Place can be surprisingly impermanent. Railroad towns, factory towns, canal towns, other things that have gone by the wayside as the economy changes. As climate shifts, places may change, too. Of course there is value in the frame of place as a high priority, so this line of inquiry simply brings up some shortcomings of using place as the only framing for solutions and offers alternative framings.

Space-time-capital-based solutions, or solutions that can "follow the money" is another framework.

## What people are talking about when they talk about place-based solutions
I'll come back in and add a section here.
## Shortcomings of place-based as a primary frame
Might lead to over-indexing on place, when in fact solutions should "follow the puck".
## Some alternative framings
Temporary-based solutions
